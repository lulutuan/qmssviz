This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
getwd()
setwd("C:/Users/user/Documents/qmssviz")

lgas <- read.csv("lgas.csv")
south.lgas <- subset(lgas, lgas$zone == "Southeast"  |lgas$zone == "South-South" | lgas$zone == "Southwest")
pop.lgas <- south.lgas[,c(1,3)]

south.lgas <- south.lgas[,c(1,6)]
south.lgas <- merge(south.lgas, pop.lgas, by="lga_id")

newdata <- south.lgas[order(-south.lgas$pop_2006),]


health.data <- read.csv('sample_health_facilities.csv')
summary(health.data$zone)

health.data <- subset(health.data, health.data$zone == "South-South" | health.data$zone == "Southeast" | health.data$zone == "Southwest")

pop.lgas <- lgas[,c(1,3)]

merge.data <- merge(health.data, pop.lgas, by="lga_id")

doctor <- by(merge.data$num_doctors_fulltime, merge.data$state, sum, na.rm=TRUE)
nurse <- by(merge.data$num_nurses_fulltime, merge.data$state, sum, na.rm=TRUE)

total.number <- doctor+nurse

final.data <- merge.data[order(-merge.data$pop_2006),]
final.data

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
